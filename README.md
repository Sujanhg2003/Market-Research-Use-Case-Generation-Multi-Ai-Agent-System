### Market Research Use Case Generation Multi Ai Agent System

### Abstract
#### The objective of this project is to design and implement a multi- agent system that generates relevant AI and Generative AI (GenAI) use cases for a given company or industry. The system conducts in- depth market research, analyzes industry trends, and provides a comprehensive set of resources aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and customer experience through AI/ML solutions. This project lever- ages cutting-edge tools such as Langchain and Google Generative AI (Gemini-Pro) to automate the research and use case generation pro- cess, thereby offering practical insights to organizations invarious sectors.

### Introduction
#### In today’s fast-paced business environment, companies are increasingly adopt- ing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) solutions to optimizeoperations, improve customer experiences, and drive innovation. However, identifying and implementing suitable AI use cases can be a complex andresource-intensive task. This project aims to automate the generation of AI and GenAI use cases tailored to specific industries and companies. The multi-agent architecture not only analyzes market trends but also proposes actionable solutions supported by relevant datasets and resources.The system comprises several agents working in tandem to complete tasks such as industry research, use case generation, and resource collection. These agents operate within a well defined workflow that ensures a seamless and efficient process.

### Methodology
#### The multi-agent system was built using the Langchain library and Google’s Generative AI model (Gemini-Pro). The architecture consists of three main agents: the Data Collection Agent, the Use Case Generation Agent, and the Resource Collection Agent. Each agent performs a distinct task in the process, and their outputs are sequentially fed into one another.

### System Architecture
#### The architecture of the system can be described in three main stages:
#### 1. Data Collection: The system uses a DuckDuckGo search tool tocollect information about the company and its industry. It gathers data on the company’s products, services, strategic focus, and industry trends related to AI, ML, and GenAI.
#### 2. Use Case Generation: Based on the collected data, the system generates relevant AI/ML/GenAI use cases for the company. The use cases are presented in a structured format, highlighting pros, cons, opportunities, and risks associated with each case.
#### 3. Resource Collection: For each proposed use case, the system identifies and collects relevant datasets, APIs, and research papers from platforms like Kaggle, HuggingFace, and GitHub. These resources arethen provided to the user to facilitate implementation.

#### Tools and Technologies
#### • Langchain: A library that enables the integration of various tools and agents into a seamless system.
#### • Google Generative AI (Gemini-Pro): A language model used to generate the content for industry research, use case generation, and resource collection.
#### • DuckDuckGoSearchRun: A web search tool used for collecting industryrelated data.

### System Workflow
#### The multi-agent system follows a sequential workflow that integrates the agents for optimal performance:
 #### Step 1: Data Collection Task
#### The system starts by gathering information about the company and its industry. The Data Collection Agent uses the DuckDuckGo search tool to identify key trends, products, and focus areas of the company. It also highlights trends in the industry that are relevant to AI, ML, and GenAI technologies.
#### Step 2: Use Case Generation Task
#### Once the trends are identified, the Use Case Generation Agent creates actionable and innovative AI, ML, and GenAI use cases tailored to the company. The system structures the use cases into four categories: Pros, Cons, Opportunities, and Risks, ensuring that each use case is feasible and impactful.
#### Step 3: Resource Collection Task
#### After the use cases are generated, the Resource Collection Agent identifies and collects relevant resources for each use case. This includes datasets from Kaggle, HuggingFace, and GitHub, APIs, and key research papers. Theresources are categorized based on the use cases to ensure that the company has everything needed to implement the solutions.

### Conclusion
#### The multi-agent system successfully automates the process of researching AI and GenAI use cases for companies in various industries. By leveraging advanced tools like Langchain and Google’s Gemini-Pro, the system provides tailored, actionable insights that companies can use to enhance operations and customer satisfaction. The ability to collect relevant resources further supports the implementation of these use cases, ensuring that companies are well-equipped to leverage AI/ML technologies
